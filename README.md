# Soccer Stars Game Simulation
This project is a simulation of the Soccer Stars Game, implemented using C++ language, object-oriented programming, and the RSDL library.

## Overview
The Soccer Stars Game is a popular arcade-style soccer game where players control small characters to score goals and win the game. The objective of this project is to simulate the gameplay of the Soccer Stars Game using C++ programming language and RSDL library, with the following features:

- Object-oriented design and implementation, with classes for the game, players, ball, and other game elements.
- Event-driven programming, where the game responds to user input in real-time, such as moving players and shooting the ball.
- Physics simulation, where the movement of the ball and players are calculated based on their position, velocity, and acceleration.

## Requirements
To run the Soccerstars Game Simulation, you need the following software installed on your computer:

* C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang.
* RSDL library, which provides the game window and input/output functionality.
* SDL library, which provides multimedia functionality.

## Usage
To run the Soccerstars Game Simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using the C++ compiler and the RSDL library.
4. Run the executable file to start the game.

In the game, move the players in the right direction (towards the ball) 


use the arrow keys to move your player, and press the spacebar to shoot the ball towards the goal. The game ends when one of the players scores a goal, and the winner is declared.
